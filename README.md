## Introduction

This web application is being developed as part of my final degree project for the Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science Engineering.

The developed web application aims to provide a comprehensive management platform for 3D printers and the materials used in the printing process.
Within this platform, users will share a common workspace as part of a group, where they can upload 3dPrints, comment on other members’ projects, and actively collaborate.
In addition, the system will deliver detailed insights on material usage and estimated printing times, ensuring efficient inventory tracking and production management within the group.
Ultimately, the goal is to centralize collaboration, monitoring, and optimization of 3D printing processes in a single, unified solution.

A common use case is the application for managing the resources of a 3D printing shop. In this scenario, a group is created to centralize the administration of the shop’s resources and maintain accurate inventory control. This includes monitoring printer usage time, tracking filament and material consumption, as well as recording 3dPrints and the resources utilized, whether in terms of time or supplies.

> At this stage, only the functional and technical objectives of the application have been defined. The development process has not yet started.

## Objectives
### Functional Objectives
- Create users and allow registration with different roles and permissions.
- Implement CRUD operations for the entities: printers, filaments, 3dPrints, and users.
- Visualize data extracted from 3D printing G-code files to provide technical insights into the printing process.
- Send notification emails to users, including alerts about comments on 3dPrints or depleted filaments.
- Estimate printing times based on the history of 3dPrints and printers.
- Display user notes for printed 3dPrints.
- Develop a comprehensive system that enables the management and control of 3D printing processes.

### Technical Objectives: Architecture and Project Technologies

#### 1. General Structure
- **Architecture:** Monolithic with REST API implemented in ASP.NET Core (.NET 8), with logical layer separation
- **Frontend:** Single Page Application (SPA) implemented in React, communicating with the backend via HTTP calls to the REST API.  
- **Database:** MySQL, using stored procedures for all SQL logic.

#### 2. Detailed Technologies
| Layer / Component | Technology / Tool | Notes |
|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Backend (REST API) | ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8) | Controllers, BLL, and DAL(ADO.NET + stored procedures) organized in layers with clear separation of responsibilities |
| Frontend (SPA) | React | Communicates with backend via fetch or Axios, interactive and dynamic UI design |
| Database | MySQL | Stored procedures, initialization scripts, and sample data |
| Automated Testing | XUnit (backend), Selenium (UI) | Validation of main functionalities and API endpoints |
| API Documentation | Swagger/Postman | Interactive documentation with Swagger, Postman collection for interactive and exportable testing.|
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Build, test, and automatic deployment pipeline to Azure |
| Deployment | Azure App Service / Docker Container | Deploy backend and frontend, scalable and ready for load testing |
| Repository | GitHub |Version control |

#### 3. Data Flow
1. The user interacts with the React frontend.  
2. React makes HTTPS calls to the ASP.NET Core backend.  
3. The API calls the BLL to process business logic.  
4. The BLL calls the DAL, which executes stored procedures in MySQL via ADO.NET.  
5. Results are returned to the BLL, then to the API, and finally to the frontend to display data or reports.

### Images and graphics
#### Entity Images
Each main entity **filaments, printers, 3dPrints, and users** will be represented by a image or icon.  
These visual representations serve for quick identification between users and they can instantly recognize the type of entity they are interacting with.  

#### Graphs and Charts
Visualizations will play a key role in making the system’s data more understandable and actionable. Initial implementations include:

- **General Dashboard:** A circular (pie) chart will display the total printing hours of each printer in the group. This allows managers and users to quickly assess the workload distribution among printers.  
- **Printer Details:** Each printer will feature a bar chart showing its success rate over time, providing immediate insight into reliability, and potential areas for maintenance or improvement.

---
#### Algrotims
The application will implement several algorithms to provide automatic calculations and estimations for 3D printing processes:

1. **Printer Success Rate**  
   Calculates the success rate of a printer based on the 3dPrints it prints and their status, automatically assessing performance.

2. **Estimated Printing Time**  
   Automatically estimates the actual time required to complete a 3dPrint, based on historical printing data and trends.

3. **Filament Material Estimation**  
   Estimates the remaining material on a filament according to its usage in the application, allowing better inventory management.

4. **3dPrint Cost Estimation**  
   Calculates the estimated cost of a printed 3dPrint based on the material consumed from the filament used.

These algorithms aim to provide **automated insights**, help optimize resource usage, and assist users in planning and managing 3D printing tasks more efficiently.
